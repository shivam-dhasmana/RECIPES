</ol></p>

<h3>Step 2: Cook the gravy</h3>

<li>Add ½–1 cup water (adjust consistency as you like) and bring to a gentle boil.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Step 3: Add paneer and finish</h3>
  <ol>
<li>Add paneer cubes to the gravy and cook for 2–3 minutes on low flame.</li>
<li>Crush and add kasuri methi for that restaurant-style aroma.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Step 4: Serve</h3>
<ol>

</ol>

<h3>SPECIAL TIPS</h3>
